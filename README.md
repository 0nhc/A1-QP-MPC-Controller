# A1-QP-MPC-Controller
## Introduction

This repo provides a quadruped controller that controls Unitree A1 robot, one of the most popular quadruped robots used in academic research in recent years. This controller 

To facilitate quadruped research and application development, we provides interfaces to use this controller to control either simulated robots or real robots. We support following types of robots

    1. A1 Robot simulated in Nvidia Isaac Sim Simulator
    2. A1 Robot simulated in Gazebo Simulator
    3. The A1 Robot hardware

Even if you do not have a A1 robot hardware, our simulation demo can let you do research in either the Gazebo simulator or the Nvidia Isaac Sim simulator. 

The features of this controller includes

    - real time QP force controller [1] based on OSQP
    - real time convex MPC controller [2] based on OSQP
    - Stair climbing demonstration (on tested in Gazebo)
    - Docker based installation
    - Intergrated ROS1 ecosystem

The controller software is architected in a way aiming to provide easy intergration with other existing ROS packages 
contain SLAM, mapping and motion planning algorithms.

## Installation

We use ROS1 as communication backbone. We assume you already have ROS1 installed on your computer. We recommend that the controller being installed in a Docker container. Therefore on different computers (desktop for simuation, onboard computer for hardware control), the controller can run in a common environment. 

The software only tested in **Ubuntu 18.04** and **ROS melodic**. 

First, get the dockerfile in the "docker/" folder. Build the docker using command

```shell
sudo docker build --build-arg -t="a1_cpp_ctrl_image" .
```

Then we start docker by the following command

```shell
sudo docker run -d \
                --network host \
                -v {PATH_OF_THE_REPO_ON_YOUR_HOST_COMPUTER}:/root/A1_Ctrl/ \
                --name a1_cpp_ctrl_docker \
                a1_cpp_ctrl_image
```
Notice the *PATH_OF_THE_REPO_ON_YOUR_HOST_COMPUTER* must be changed to the location of the repo folder on your computer.

We set the docker container in a way that we use ssh to access the controller. Once the docker container starts, use 

```shell
ssh root@localhost -p2233
# then input passward "password" when prompted to do so
```

We do it in this way because during development period, we can use VSCode remote or Clion to debug the program.

You can read the docker file and a tutorial at https://www.allaban.me/posts/2020/08/ros2-setup-ide-docker/ to learn more about Clion developement. (The tutorial is for ROS2 but most part of it applies to ROS1 too.) Following this article you can set CLion to compile the controller using the environment in the docker container. Additional to "Copy and paste the output into CLionâ€™s CMake environment setting."
also need to copy environment variables to "Run/Debug Configrations" of the executable to be tested. 

With the above docker run command, inside the docker, /root/A1_Ctrl/ is a regular ROS1 workspace. Execute ''catkin build'' to build the workspace. Then the ROS package a1_cpp in A1_Ctrl is ready to use.

## Isaac Sim Demo
![Issac A1](doc/isaac_a1.png)

We can use this controller to control an A1 robot in Nvidia Isaac Sim. This functionality is still under development waiting for the April 2022 Isaac Sim release.

## Gazebo Demo
![Gazebo A1](doc/gazebo_a1.png)

The Gazebo demo relies on the gazebo simulator environment developed by Unitree Robotics. However, the official environment is updated to support Unitree's new robots. So we provide a custom environment to make sure the version of unitree_legged_sdk be v3.2.  

Also, notice ROS melodic supports up to Gazebo 9 so please use Gazebo version < 9.

### Setup
On the host computer, install unitree SDK following https://github.com/ShuoYangRobotics/unitree_ros instead of the original source. Make sure by the end you can launch the A1 robot simulation using

```shell
roslaunch unitree_gazebo normal.launch rname:=a1 wname:=stairs_new
```

### Adjust the robot in the Gazebo
During the development, we can let the robot stand up by two Unitree testing scripts. The following two commands are very handy.
```shell
rosrun unitree_controller unitree_servo # let the robot stretch legs
rosrun unitree_controller unitree_move_kinetic # place the robot back to origin
```
We oftern running the two commands alternatively by running one and ctrl-C after a while to adjust the pose of the robot.
After the robot properly stands up, it is ready to be controlled. 


### Start the controller

If you have completed the instructions before, there should be a runnable docker container called `a1_ros_ctrl_docker` in your computer. 
Run the container, and start the A1 controller by
```shell
ssh root@localhost -p2233
# then input passward "password" when prompted to do so
cd /root/A1_Ctrl/
catkin build
source /root/A1_Ctrl/devel/setup.bash
echo "source /root/A1_Ctrl/devel/setup.bash" >> /.bashrc
roslaunch a1_cpp a1_ctrl.launch type:=gazebo solver_type:=mpc # solver_type can be qp or mpc
```

Now, the controller engages the robot in Gazebo. The robot has two mode: "stand" (default) and "walk". So the robot still stands.

Currently we need a Linux-supported joystick like an Xbox One Controller to drive the robot around.
you should following the insturctions in http://wiki.ros.org/joy/Tutorials/ConfiguringALinuxJoystick to setup a joystick controller.

Take Xbox One Controller as an example:

| Button | Function |
| :----- | :------- |
| Left Joystick | Control the torso's orientation |
| Right Joystick | Control the robot's walking direction |
| `A`| Switch the mode between "stand" and "walk" |

## Hardware Robot Demo
![Hardware A1](doc/hardware_a1.png)

We install an Intel NUC i7 computer on the A1 robot. We assume this computer connects to the robot LAN network already.
When the robot has power, the onboard computer should has IP 192.168.123.X.

**Again, be very careful about the unitree_legged_sdk version, it must use v3.2 or v3.3.1.** The official repo of Unitree SDK is updated to support Unitree's new robots. So A1 users must manually check out v3.3.1 branch:
https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_legged_sdk/releases/tag/v3.3.1. Our docker should already handled this but just be careful. 

Download the Dockerfile in "docker/" on the onboard computer and compile the docker from a directory called "PATH_OF_THIS_REPO_ON_YOUR_HOST_COMPUTER":
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ShuoYangRobotics/A1-QP-MPC-Controller.git
cd docker/
sudo docker build --build-arg -t="a1_ros_ctrl_image" .
```

Then we start docker by

```shell
docker run -it --network host \
                --cap-add=IPC_LOCK --cap-add=sys_nice \
                -v {PATH_OF_THIS_REPO_ON_YOUR_HOST_COMPUTER}:/root/A1_Ctrl/ \
                --name a1_cpp_ctrl_docker \
                a1_ros_ctrl_image
```
Then get insider the docker by 
```shell
docker start a1_cpp_ctrl_docker
```
and then
```shell
ssh root@localhost -p2233
# then input passward "password" when prompted to do so
```

Go to folder "/root/A1_Ctrl/", then do 
```shell
catkin build 
source /root/A1_Ctrl/devel/setup.bash
echo "source /root/A1_Ctrl/devel/setup.bash" >> /.bashrc
```

Make sure the A1 robot is in "standby" mode, in which the robot is ready to receive joint commands. There are two ways to do this.
The first approach is very hacky (but also handy): When A1 robot's battery turns on, 
the robot will first do an initialization sequence and then run its built-in controller.
If now the onboard computer sends a command with all 0, the built-in controller will be 
interrupted and the robot enters standby mode. The second approach is after the robot starts 
and stands up, press "L2+B" buttons on the A1 remote controller. 

Now the A1 robot is in standby mode, we can run controller from the docker. Inside the docker,
we first 
```shell
rosparam load /root/A1_Ctrl/src/a1_cpp/config/hardware_a1_mpc.yaml
```
Then start the controller by go to /root/A1_Ctrl/deve/lib/a1_cpp
```shell
./hardware_a1_ctrl
```

Or use a roslaunch file
```shell
source /root/A1_Ctrl/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch a1_cpp a1_ctrl.launch type:=hardware solver_type:=mpc
# notice the type is different from the Gazebo or Isaac simulation; solver_type can be qp or mpc
```

The robot should stand up now using our controller. If now there is a joy command in the
ROS environment (come from either an XBox joystick attaches to the robot or from
another device in the network), the robot can respond to the joy command the same way
as that in the Gazebo demo.
